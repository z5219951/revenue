# 2020T2-COMP9417-Project

## Overview
In a worldâ€¦ where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? For some movies, it's "You had me at 'Hello.'" For others, the trailer falls short of expectations and you think "What we have here is a failure to communicate."

In this project, we're presented with metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. 

## Acknowledgement

This dataset has been collected from TMDB. The movie details, credits and keywords have been collected from the TMDB Open API. This project uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB. Their API also provides access to data on many additional movies, actors and actresses, crew members, and TV shows.
