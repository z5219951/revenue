# 2020T2-COMP9417-Project

## Overview
In a worldâ€¦ where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? For some movies, it's "You had me at 'Hello.'" For others, the trailer falls short of expectations and you think "What we have here is a failure to communicate."

In this competition, you're presented with metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. You can collect other publicly available data to use in your model predictions, but in the spirit of this competition, use only data that would have been available before a movie's release.

Join in, "make our day", and then "you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?'"

## Data

In this dataset, you are provided with 7398 movies and a variety of metadata obtained from The Movie Database (TMDB). Movies are labeled with id. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries.

You are predicting the worldwide revenue for 4398 movies in the test file.

Note - many movies are remade over the years, therefore it may seem like multiple instance of a movie may appear in the data, however they are different and should be considered separate movies. In addition, some movies may share a title, but be entirely unrelated.

E.g. The Karate Kid (id: 5266) was released in 1986, while a clearly (or maybe just subjectively) inferior remake (id: 1987) was released in 2010. Also, while the Frozen (id: 5295) released by Disney in 2013 may be the household name, don't forget about the less-popular Frozen (id: 139) released three years earlier about skiers who are stranded on a chairlift...
