# Second Meeting

Date: 12 July, 2020

## Group Member:
- Tim Luo
- Yue Qi
- Shu Yang
- Yixiao Zhan

## Meeting Record
Today,  we talk about the main structure about our project. Tim believed that we should split developemt into: 1. Data preprocessing 2. Feature engineering 3. Algorithm (Regression, model training etc). One person on 1, one person on 2. Two people on 3. And when 1 & 2 finish, they help with 3. There's a lot to do with (1) including splitting numerical data and categorical data and choosing the right ones to pass onto (2) feature engineering before it goes onto (3). Then Shu pointed out that we can use gradient boosting as our method. Besides, Tim suggest that we can use random forrest + gradient boosting as solution. Since the result of the model still needs testing, we agree that we should try multible models.

Then we make a timeline as follow:
- Wk7 - Wk8: ~30% complete (just to get things going)
- Wk8 - Wk9: ~70% complete (everything is almost in place)
- Wk9 - Wk10: 100% complete
- Wk10 - Wk10.5: Tidy up, start on report
- Wk10.5 - End of week 10: Finish report

We seperate word as below:
- Yixiao and Yue do data preprocessing
- Tim and Shu do algorithm

Finally we decide that we should make a team meeting every Sunday.
